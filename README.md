A decentralized service for paid content distribution that leverages the power of the Lightning Network to facilitate atomic and trust-free transactions for any digital content purchase.

**For customers:**
- **Content Claim**: Make sure you get the content that creator claimed as long as you paid. 
- **Atomic Purchases**: Experience the assurance that once payment is made, the delivery of your digital content is guaranteed by our robust system.
- **Zero Hidden Fees**: Our atomic purchase process is transparent, with no additional costs besides LN fee.
